## Overview

This project applies **Deep Learning** techniques to solve a specific problem using advanced neural networks. It includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and deployment. The dataset includes 5 **NIFTY50** stocks which are HDFC Bank, Infosys, L&T, Reliance and TCS.

## Features

- **Preprocessing of input data** for optimal model performance
- **Deep Neural Network (DNN) training** using modern architectures
- **Evaluation using Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and Loss Metrics**
- **Visualization of model performance**
- **Deployment-ready pipeline**

## Technologies Used

- **Python** (TensorFlow, Keras, PyTorch, NumPy, Pandas)
- **Deep Learning** (CNN, RNN, Transformer-based Models)
- **Data Visualization** (Matplotlib, Seaborn)

## Installation

### Prerequisites

Ensure Python 3.8+ is installed, then install dependencies:

```sh
pip install tensorflow keras torch numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn
```

## Usage

1. **Run the Jupyter Notebook**:
   ```sh
   jupyter notebook DLproject_final.ipynb
   ```
2. **Follow the steps in the notebook**:
   - Load and preprocess data
   - Train the deep learning model
   - Evaluate and visualize results

## Evaluation Metrics

- **Accuracy** – Measures overall correctness
- **Loss** – Tracks model learning progress
- **Precision & Recall** – Used for classification models

## Future Enhancements

- **Hyperparameter tuning** for improved accuracy
- **Addition of Transfer Learning** for better performance
- **Deployment as a web app**
